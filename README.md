Melon Ripeness Detection Dataset

Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into three main subsets: training, validation, and testing. Each subset contains images and their corresponding label files that are essential for training, validating, and testing machine learning models, particularly in object detection tasks.

1. Train Set (train_melon)
Images Folder (train_melon/images/)
Contains the images used for training the model.
Labels Folder (train_melon/labels/)
Contains the label files corresponding to each image in the training set. Each label file includes bounding box coordinates and class information (e.g., 'ripe' or 'unripe').
2. Validation Set (valid_melon)
Images Folder (valid_melon/images/)
Contains the images used for validating the model's performance during training.
Labels Folder (valid_melon/labels/)
Contains the label files corresponding to each image in the validation set.
3. Test Set (test_melon)
Images Folder (test_melon/images/)
Contains the images used for final testing and evaluation of the model's performance.
Labels Folder (test_melon/labels/)
Contains the label files corresponding to each image in the test set.
File Descriptions:
labels.cache (Optional): This file might be a cache file generated by the labeling tool or machine learning framework to speed up data loading. It is not necessary for the dataset structure but can be kept for convenience during model training.
Each image is paired with a corresponding label file that provides the annotation information necessary for object detection tasks, particularly in identifying whether a melon is 'ripe' or 'unripe'.
